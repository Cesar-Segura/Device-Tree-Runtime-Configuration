# Device-Tree-Runtime-Configuration

Need to update this with file information and structure (general API?)

# TODO:
- Error check for malloc failures
- Review placement of offset alignment functions
- Figure out a better way of error propogation through the embedded functions
- Backwards compatibility with older versions of device tree
- Better printing of property values
